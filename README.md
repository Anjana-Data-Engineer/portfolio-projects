Welcome to my portfolio repository!
This collection showcases end-to-end projects demonstrating my skills in Python, Backend Development, Data Engineering, ETL Pipelines, Automation, AWS Cloud, CI/CD, and Analytics.

Each project is designed to reflect real-world engineering scenarios — including REST API development, serverless data pipelines, automated SDLC tools, streaming systems, and interactive dashboards. All projects follow clean code, modular structure, and production-oriented engineering practices.
