Welcome to my portfolio repository!
This collection showcases end-to-end projects demonstrating my skills in Python, Backend Development, Data Engineering, ETL Pipelines, Automation, AWS Cloud, CI/CD, and Analytics.

Each project is designed to reflect real-world engineering scenarios — including REST API development, serverless data pipelines, automated SDLC tools, streaming systems, and interactive dashboards. All projects follow clean code, modular structure, and production-oriented engineering practices.

🚀 Projects Overview
Project	Description	Tech Stack
1. AWS ETL Pipeline (S3 → Lambda → PostgreSQL)	Serverless ETL pipeline to ingest raw files from S3, transform via Lambda, and load into PostgreSQL. Includes validation, logging & automation.	Python, AWS Lambda, S3, RDS, SQLAlchemy
2. Flask Backend API Service	Secure REST API with CRUD operations, JWT auth, Dockerization, and CI-friendly test coverage.	Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, pytest
3. Data Quality Automation Framework	YAML-driven DQ engine performing schema, null, duplicate, and range validations on datasets.	Python, Pandas, YAML, SQL
4. Real-Time Log Monitoring System	Streaming pipeline to process logs in real-time and display live alerts/dashboard.	Python, Redis/Kafka, Flask, WebSockets
5. SDLC Automation & Validation Toolkit	CI-integrated automation suite validating linting, test coverage, docs, config, and JIRA linkage before merge.	Python, GitHub Actions, Flake8, Coverage
6. Personal Finance Analytics Dashboard	Upload CSV → clean → analyze → visualize spending trends and insights interactively.
